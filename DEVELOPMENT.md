# Project Structure

Capire se descrivere le project folder o se inserirle mano a mano, in base al contesto.

Leapp is an application built using Electron and Angular. The first is used in order to generate executables for different OSs: macOS, Windows, and Linux distros. It serves as a wrapper for the Angular site which hosts the application logic, by serving it through a combination of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) and Node.js.

If you are new to Electron, please refer to the official [documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest).

Angular is a front-end web development framework for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps via HTML, Typescript, and modern SCSS. 

If you are new to Angular, why not try the excellent **tour of heroes** [sample project](https://angular.io/tutorial) to get you started?

After you got yourself acquainted with our development tools, let’s dig into our code structure.

## Monorepo

To facilitate and keep track of contributions, we will approach a monorepo architecture; it allows maintaining different projects under the same repository. The current repository is not yet organized in a monorepo fashion. It will be introduced with Leapp Core and CLI. The Core will contain the application logic; basically, it will act as a library on top of which clients, like the Desktop Application and the CLI, will run. In the monorepo scenario, Desktop Application, CLI, and Core will be three different projects under the same repository.

## Electron project elements

There is an **electron** folder generated by Electron at the root of the repository. It contains the **main.ts** file which drives the application setup and starts the executable by injecting the Angular application into the main BrowserWindow. This is created after the Angular project has been set up, cleaned, compressed, and distributed as a minimized site.

## Angular project elements

The Angular project is wrapped in the Electron one and implements the logic behind each Leapp concept. Let’s dive into the Angular project, from the UX/UI elements to the low level ones, i.e. Models and Services. 

### Modules

Modules are elements in an Angular project that allows using different components that are defined in the same functional scope. In Leapp we have **3 modules**.

- **app.module.ts**: contains all the **global libraries ad components.** Here you can put all the external libraries that you need.
- **layout.module.ts**: is specific for the layout component, and contains only information that is used in the layout.component.ts file. It is called inside the app module.
- **components.module.ts**: is the module responsible for holding all the components of the application. It is called inside the app module.

There is also one super simple **app.routing.module**, which contains only one route pointing to the layout which contains our **3 main components**: **sidebar**, **command-bar**, **and sessions**.

### Components

Inside the Component folder, there are all the different components of the applications, which are composed of a UI file in the form of an HTML template, a SCSS file, that contains the style, and finally, 2 TypeScript files: <component>.ts for the logic, and <component>.spec.ts for the unit tests.

Components represent core UI/UX functionalities. If you intend to define a new functionality that must have its UI counterpart, please insert the new component here. 

There is also a dialogs folder that contains, for easiness, all the dialog components of Leapp. 

For us, it is best to create a new component every time we need a new dialog in the interface, just to keep things well separated and DRY.

### Models

The Models folder contains TypeScript interfaces that represents the state of Leapp, that is persisted in Leapp’s configuration file, and other interfaces that needs to be centralized and used across different logic inside the Angular project.

For what concerns the state of the application, you’ll find a definition of all the supported Sessions and a Workspace object which represents the template of the configuration file.

The Workspace includes:

- a list of all the created Sessions;
- the default region and location (region for AWS, location for Azure);
- the IdP URLs the IAM Role Federated Sessions rely on;
- the AWS Named Profiles;
- the AWS SSO Integrations;
- all the Segments created by the user to filter out Sessions while using the desktop application.

### Services

Leapp's project is built on a set of **services** that realize the **core functionalities**.

The actual project's structure is structured to allow developers to contribute to source code in the easier and atomic way possible.

In particular, we want to focus the attention on the development of Session Service Patterns and Integrations.

**Session Service Pattern**

A specific service manages the way each type of Session will handle the process of credentials generation.

![](docs/images/contributing/project_structure/PROJECT_STRUCTURE-1.png)

There is a **three-level abstraction** implementation for this kind of service:

- A general **Session Service** is the top level of abstraction of a Session, it implements the state management of any Session in the app and has three abstract methods for Start, Stop, and Rotate.
- A **Provider Session Service** (i.e., *AWSSessionService*) extends the general session service and handles credentials for a specific Cloud Provider to Start, Stop, and Rotate each Session of this type. This level of abstraction unifies all the common actions for all the Access Methods within a Cloud Provider.
- A **Provider Access Method Service** (i.e., *AWSIAMUserService*) is the concrete implementation of all the information needed to generate the credentials for a specific Access Method. It implements both CRUD methods and the specific steps to generate credentials for a given Access Method.

### Integrations

To understand this concept, let’s dive into what the AWS SSO feature does. 

In Leapp you can work with Sessions that corresponds to AWS accounts that belong to one or more AWS Organizations. By configuring AWS SSO in the root account (or another dedicated account), you're able to manage access to all of the AWS Organization’s accounts. 

AWS SSO configuration is bound to a specific region (e.g. eu-west-1, etc.) and portal URL. The last one corresponds to the endpoint used to log into AWS SSO. By logging into AWS SSO through the AWS SDK, you have access to a token that can be used to list all the accounts and roles that can be accessed by the user. AWS SSO API allows you to automatically generate temporary credentials to access accounts with a specific role. Once you’re done, you can log out from AWS SSO.

From this behaviour we extrapulated the concept of Integration that can be applied to other third-party services like - for example - Okta and OneLogin.

The concept of Integration encapsulates the following behaviours:

- login - logging into the Integration and get an access token to exploit its APIs;
- sync - automatically provision all the accounts and roles that can be access by the user through the access token;
- logout - logging out from the Integration.

### Errors

These folder contains Leapp standard errors, from the less specific LeappBaseError to the more specific ones. The specific errors extend LeappBaseError, inheriting attributes like name, context, and severity.

### Environments

Here you’ll find project’s constants that will be merged soon into the Constants model to avoid misunderstandings. We’ll leave here only information related to the environment the application is running in, e.g. development or production.

# Build

The package.json file contains all the build scripts, in addition to the dependencies and other project’s metadata. You can find this file in the root of the project.

All the scripts are grouped under the “scripts” key. There you can find the “build-and-run-dev” script that you can use to build and run the Electron application locally.

# Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot the electron application in the development environment, please refer to [this](https://docs.leapp.cloud/troubleshooting/app-data/) documentation page. Moreover, you may find it useful to open the Developer Tools from the Electron’s BrowserWindow that hosts the Angular application.

# Linting

We are using [eslint](https://eslint.org/) as our project’s linter. its configuration is defined in the .eslintrc.json file, present in the project’s root folder. There you can find all style rules that apply to the code.

# Conventional Commits and Pull Request
