An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS.

A IAM User in AWS consists of a name and a set of long-term credentials. Leapp never set these values in the configuration files, and automatically generates and refresh a set of short-term credentials to make available.

!!! Info
  
    If you want to know how Leapp generates and refresh short-term credentials refer to the [credentials generation](/security/credentials-generation/aws/) section in the documentation.
