A dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD that's automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. An Azure tenant represents a single organization.

An Azure Tenant consists of a name and a set of long-term credentials. 

!!! Info

    For azure-cli version < 2.30.0: Leapp enhances security of Azure credentials by removing *refresh token* from the accessTokens.json file 
    which could potentially allow an attacker accessing a User's PC to regenerate valid credentials even 
    if a valid access token is not present and by **rotating** Azure access token.
