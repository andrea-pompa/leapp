# Overview

## Welcome to Leapp :rocket:

Leapp is a tool for developers to manage, secure, and access to the cloud.

All data is **persisted and encrypted on your workstation**. Head to our [Security](/security/intro) section to know how we guarantee the highest level of security.

The name **Leapp** is inspired by the English word *leap* and pronounced */l:ip/*. We choose this name because the project enables you to be one step away from your cloud environments.
